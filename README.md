Personal style guide for tweeting
=================

Editor note: this list is under continuous development.

=

This is a personal collection of styles related to how I compose tweets for Twitter. Think of this style guide in the same manner as the [_Associated Press Stylebook_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Stylebook). [more context needed]


=

### Abbreviations

Abbreviations will be used appropriately and utilized for readability purposes.

Editor note: there may be some differences between using truncated words, e.g., "info".

=

### Hashtags

The number of hashtags, `#`, shouldn't exceed five per tweets. Hashtags are meant to include tags that are relevant to the tweet and will be used with discretion.

Hashtags will first be included in the tweet text when applicable. Example:

> &#35;ProTip: a &#35;password strength indicator isn't going to stop users from choosing "123456" for a password. Tougher input criteria will.

If hashtags can't be included with the tweet text they will be included after. Example:

> MT for all devs! "How To Be A Great Developer" by @funkatron. https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-january-6 via @thepastrybox &#35;career &#35;social &#35;programming


=

### Spacing


=

### Line breaks

Line breaks will be used with discretion. They should be utilized for readability purposes (e.g., with numbered lists and conversations). Example:

> [insert example]


=

### Quotes

Curved single and double quotes (smart quotes) will be used except in instances where code may be included. Example:
    
> `content { " "; }`

=

### Code

Code can be included in tweet text but should be used sparingly and only to communicate relavent information. Code will be identified with backticks `` `...` ``. Example:


> No more `` `grunt-contrib-sass` ``. From now on it's `` `grunt-sass` ``, FTW!

> 

Markup can be included without backticks. Example:

> My point is more that &lt;div&gt; is misused for specificity, e.g., &lt;div id="nav"&gt; instead of &lt;nav&gt;.

Consider using a combination of backticks with markup: `` `<font color="red">` ``

=

### Retweets

Retweets are tweets from other and follows that individual's personal style.

#### Quoted Retweets

The first priority of quoted retweets is to not edit the original tweet. However, hashtags can be inserted into the original tweet, if appropriate. All quoted retweets will include RT prior to the first quotation.


=

### Grammar

(Might be hard to follow correct grammar)

=

### Punctuation

Examples:
    
* .
* ?
* !
* Elipsis (...): An elipsis will be used as appropriate. Using the elipsis character instead of three (3) periods in a row is more efficient because it will save two characters overall in the tweet. 
* ?! (and multiple: ?!?!)
 

=

### Emoji

Example:

* :-/
* O_o
