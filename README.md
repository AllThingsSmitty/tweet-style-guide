# Personal style guide for tweets

**Editor note:** this list is under continuous development.

This is a personal collection of styles related to how I compose tweets on Twitter. Think of this style guide in the same manner as the [_Associated Press Stylebook_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Stylebook).


## Table of contents

1. [Abbreviations](#abbreviations)
2. [Hashtags](#hashtags)
3. [Spacing](#spacing)
4. [Line Breaks](#line-breaks)
5. [Quotes](#quotes)
6. [Retweets](#retweets)
7. [Grammar](#grammar)
8. [Punctuation](#punctuation)
9. [Special Characters](#special-characters)
10. [Emoji](#emoji)


## Abbreviations

Abbreviations will be used as appropriate for readability purposes, e.g., Mr., Mrs., Dr. In cases where truncated words may be used, e.g., "info", those will be determined based on style and available character space.

**Note**: Avoid use of abbreviations that take away from the readibility of the tweet, e.g., "Yr." instead of "year".

### Acronyms

Acronyms will be utilized to maximize readability, available character space, and tagging. Where appropriate, acronyms will continue to be utilized as the first preference, e.g., UX, UI, IE, etc.


## Hashtags

The number of hashtags (#) shouldn't exceed five per tweets. Hashtags are meant to include tags that are relevant to the tweet and will be used with discretion.

Hashtags will first be included in the tweet text when applicable. Example:

> &#35;ProTip: a &#35;password strength indicator isn't going to stop users from choosing "123456" for a password. Tougher input criteria will.

If hashtags can't be included with the tweet text they will be included after. Example:

> MT for all devs! "How To Be A Great Developer" by @funkatron. https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-january-6 via @thepastrybox &#35;career &#35;social &#35;programming


## Spacing


## Line Breaks

Line breaks will be used with discretion. They should be utilized for readability purposes (e.g., with numbered lists and conversations). Example:

> Pre-deployment ritual:<br><br>1) beer<br>2) The Clash<br>3) 50 push-ups<br>4) Daft Punk<br>5) fireworks<br><br>Alright, I’m ready to handle code now.


## Quotes

Curved single and double quotes (smart quotes) will be used except in instances where code may be included. Example:
    
> &#x60;content { " "; }&#x60;


## Code

Code can be included in tweet text but should be used sparingly and only to communicate relavent information. Code will be encapsulated in backticks (&#x60;). Example:

> No more &#x60;grunt-contrib-sass&#x60;. From now on it's &#x60;grunt-sass&#x60;, FTW!

Markup can be included without backticks. Example:

> My point is more that &lt;div&gt; is misused for specificity, e.g., &lt;div id="nav"&gt; instead of &lt;nav&gt;.

Consider using a combination of backticks with markup: &#x60;<font color="red">&#x60;


## Retweets

Retweets are tweets from other and follows that individual's personal style.

### Quoted Retweets

The first priority of quoted retweets is to not edit the original tweet. However, hashtags can be inserted into the original tweet, if appropriate. All quoted retweets will include RT prior to the first quotation mark of the original tweet. Example:

> Civic &#35;Trolling&#8482;. RT “<a href="https://twitter.com/davatron5000">@davatron5000</a>: So I trolled the White House and wrote some postmortem&#39;y thoughts on it all <a href="http://daverupert.com/2013/10/trolling-the-whitehouse/">http://daverupert.com/2013/10/trolli...</a>”


## Grammar

(Might be hard to follow correct grammar. Might remove.)


## Punctuation

* .
* ?
* !
* Colon (:): Words following colons will be in lowercase unless otherwise indicated, e.g., title.
* Elipsis (...): An elipsis will be used as appropriate. Using the elipsis character instead of three (3) periods in a row is more efficient because it will save two characters overall in the tweet. 
* ?! (and multiple: ?!?!)


## Special Characters

### Twitter Special Characters

Twitter's primary special characters are the commercial at (@) and hashtag (#) symbols. Both will be treated as appropriate except in instances where they don't represent Twitter's expectations of the symbols.

In instances where the commercial at is being used for purposes other than to reference a Twitter name (e.g., in CSS @supports, etc.) a zero-width space with be used after the commerical at to prevent Twitter from recognizing it as a user (i.e., @supports instead of [@supports](http://twitter.com/supports)).

In instances where the hashtag is being used for purposes other than to tag a word in a tweet (e.g., #1 team, etc.) the number abbreviations No. will be used.


## Emoji

**Example:**

* <3
* :-/
* O_o
